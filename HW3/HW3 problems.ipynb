    "Suppose we have $N$ independent, identical, distinguishable harmonic oscillators. Let's follow the microcanonical approach. Measuring energy in units of $\\hbar\\omega$ (and ignoring the gs energy), the energy of oscillator $i$ can be $E_i=0,1,2,\\ldots$. Calculate the multiplicity $g(N,E)$ of the macrostate given by the total energy of the system, $E$ (and $N$, which we will consider fixed). Then take the thermodynamic limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, and find the entropy density $s=\\frac{\\log g}{N}$, and energy density $u=\\frac{E}{N}$. Hence find the temperature $T$ as a function of energy $u$ (set $k_B=1$, i.e. measure temperature in units of energy)."
